### Lets have a general idea about abstract data types and data structures.

It's easy to forget when you're not diving everyday in a new algorithm problem that data structures aren't the same thing as Abstract data types. For me, when I hear abstract data types I'm immediately teleported back in my old college years in a course bench while trying to draw an array copy or instantiating a new heap, all of this while the dangerous mathematical symbols  where getting displayed on the teachers board.

But jokes aside, it's very important to know what type of data structure we should use to implement an abstract data type, this can save a lot of time execution for some certain problems.

### Abstract Data types

We can see abstract data types as the set of operations that are not dependent on their implementation and neither of the object types. We can see them from the users point of view.

Usually the abstract data types are represented mathematical, but we we can give a short overview for the most common of them without getting into details.

The most common operations for ADTs:

* constructor for the elements
* Destructor
* Element access
* Instance manipulation 
* Verification of the instances 

The most common ADTs:

 1. [Container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_(abstract_data_type))
 2. [List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_(abstract_data_type) "List (abstract data type)")
 3. [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type) "Set (abstract data type)")
 4. [Multiset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)#Multiset "Set (abstract data type)")
 5. [Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array "Associative array")
 6. [Multimap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimap "Multimap")
 7. [Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type) "Graph (abstract data type)")
 8. [Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure) "Tree (data structure)")
 9. [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type) "Stack (abstract data type)")
10. [Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type) "Queue (abstract data type)")
11. [Priority queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue "Priority queue")
12. [Double-ended queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue "Double-ended queue")

### Data Structures

Data structures are used to implement ADTs. Usually there are multiple implementation for one ADTs. For example we can implement a stack by using   
We can see data structures from two major points: 

_Logical_, the way data binds together

_Memory,_ the way data is represented in memory. Also here 3 categories can be found:

* Static like articles and arrays
* Semi-static like queues, stacks
* Dynamic like Linked List and Trees

Commonly used Data Structures:

* Arrays
* Linked list
* Hash Tables
* Binary trees
* Graphs
* Heap
